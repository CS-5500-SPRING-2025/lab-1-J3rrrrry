[How to use Github / How to submit](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/labs?id=github-classroom)

For this lab, you will include all of your "answers" in this README file. Make sure to cite any sources you use. 

Reminder, this is the syntax to include an image in a markdown (`.md`) file:
```markdown
![](path/to/file/image.png)

Example - if a file called test.png was located in this folder:
![alt-text](test.png)
```

## Task 0: Declare your AI Usage

After you completed this lab, make sure to submit the AI declaration form via MS Form and also upload a PDF copy of your responses to this repository and include the link to PDF in this README file. Note, you must submit this form regardless if you use AI or not. Failure to submit this form will be considered a violation of AI course policy. More details about the AI-usage course policy can be found [here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy).

[Link to AI Usage Disclosure MS Form](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy?id=disclosure-of-ai-use)

- You will need to log in with your SFU email to access the form. If you're unsuccessful, try using a different browser or incognito mode. Clearing your cache and cookies may also help.

Name the file in the following format: 

`L#_AI_Declaration_FirstName_LastName_StudentID.pdf`

Example (Lab 3):

`L3_AI_Declaration_Parsa_Rajabi_123456789.pdf`

## Task 3: Lab Questions (11 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file:

### Q1 Git is a version control system for developers to track their code version changes. GitHub is a cloud plantform which host the repositories for developers to edit and update their code through Git command. Also GitHub has other tools and services for users to manage code offline and online.

### Q2 A distributed version control system(DVCS) is a type of version control. It allows all the developers have an entire copy of the whole project history on their system. Also, DVCS allows developers to make changes offline and commit to online repository.

### Q3 The first step is Edit. In this step, all the code can be edited in local environment, but the changes have not been save to the git repository yet. The second step is Stage. In this step, the code is ready to include the changes to next commit, but not committed yet. The third step is Commit. In this step, the file is committed. This means the change is stored in local repository and ready to be pushed to a remote repository.

### Q4 

#### Q4 (i) Git clone is a command to create a copy of an existing Git repository from remote source to local environment.

#### Q4 (ii) Git status is a command to show the current state of working environment and staging area.

#### Q4 (iii) Git fetch is a command to download the latest changes from a remote source to local environment.

#### Q4 (iv) Git init is a command to initialize a new Git repository in an existing environment.

#### Q4 (v) Git log is a command to show the history of commits in repository.

### Q5 .gitignore file is a text file used in a working environment to prevent unnecessary clutter. It tells Git to ignore certain sensitive or unnecessary files, preventing them from being committed to the repository, which helps keep the repository clean and secure.

## Task 4: Video Questions (4 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file.

### Q1 The video demonstrates the process of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which breaks down the complex software development process into manageable stages: requirements planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Among these, the testing phase is especially important as it plays a key role in risk management within the SDLC. Similarly, different stages of the SDLC serve different functions in software development. For example, the requirements planning stage sets the project budget, the implementation stage efficiently combines physical hardware, code, and UI design. This process enhances communication efficiency among team members at each stage and improves risk management, ultimately leading to the creation of a high-quality product that meets the budget.

### Q2 The Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) is a good framework for developers to manage resources, budegets and project timeline. By breaking down the software development into different manageable stages, SDLC could not only help develpers to identify and resolve issues early but also increase efficiency to meet the project requirement. Therefore, in SDLC, it provides many carefully planned, implementated and tested stages, which promotes origanization, risk management and efficiency for software projects.
